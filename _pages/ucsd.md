Fall 2021
======
* [CSE 234: Data Systems for Machine Learning](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//classes/fa21/cse234-a/)
    * Research based course on Machine Learning Systems, at the intersection of ML, Data management and Systems. I opted for the project pathway in the course where me along with another student partner worked on a quarter long project.
    * The course included weekly paper reviews, pertaining to seminal papers in the ML Systems area raning across source, build and deploy phases of an ML system.
    * Integrating Cerebro with Dask: [Technical report of project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-chrx22wGqx5fTEnND5NJvyzkfP4ERL/view?usp=sharing) 
* [CSE 240A: Computer Architecture](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse240a-f21/lecture-materials)
    * The course covered core concepts of computer architecture including CPU performance evaluation, instruction set architecture, pipelining, branch prediction, cache and memory hierarchy and GPU architecture.
    * The course included homework, exams, paper reviews, and a course project of implementing different branch prediction schemes.
    * Paper review of [Fat Loads: Exploiting Locality Amongst Contemporaneous Load Operations to
Optimize Cache Accesses](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3466752.3480104) : [Paper review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13t6yNPzbMNntqTVTnN5r_uAh4hZCs00x/view?usp=sharing)
    * Branch prediction algorithms comparison: [Technical report of project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YGa7M7LkvKCCIk80H_vglx96J4j5IFXA/view?usp=sharing)
* [CSE 130: Programming Languages](https://nadia-polikarpova.github.io/cse130-web/)
    * The course introduced Lambda Calculus and went through programming languages concepts using a pure functional language Haskell.
    * The course included programming assignments on lambda calculus, Haskell, higher order functions, tail recursion, recursive datatypes, environments and closures, and type classes.
