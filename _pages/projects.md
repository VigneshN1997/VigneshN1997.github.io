Research Projects
======

* **Parallelization of K-Medoids Clustering Algorithm**, BITS Pilani, **Aug '18 - Dec '18**
Advisor: Professor Poonam Goyal
    * Developed parallel K-Medoids algorithm using Adaptive Gridding for spatial partitioning in Spark Java.
    * Improved the algorithmâ€™s efficiency of selecting initial medoids without compromising the clustering error (average sample size is 10x less than the state of the art - PAMAE given any skewed data set.
