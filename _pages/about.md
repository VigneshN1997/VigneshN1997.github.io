Welcome to my abode. My name is Vignesh Nanda Kumar. I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I did my Bachelors in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus (2019 passout).

During my time at BITS, I took up courses and projects from different areas and developed an interest in the area of Large Scale Software Systems and Machine Learning. I have interned at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education which was my first experience of working on a large-scale project in a team. I have also worked at Goldman Sachs as a Summer Analyst where I got to apply concepts of Parallel Computing (Foster's Design Methodology) while developing a pluggable email scanner. After my undergraduate, I worked at American Express AI Labs as a Research Engineer. Here I was exposed to the field of ML Systems and I wish to explore the field further during my Masters.

I am exploring more about scaling ML algorithms and processing data efficiently without compromising on the performance of ML systems. With the increase in usage of ML systems, there is a need to ensure that the system is adaptable and reusable across use cases. Motivated by my experiences, I want to lead the development of ML systems impacting society on a large scale. Through this, I hope to bridge the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged to create equal opportunities for everyone.

Also, I am trying to cultivate a regular reading habit. My goal is to read at least 12 books this year. I am also a very ardent cricket fan.
