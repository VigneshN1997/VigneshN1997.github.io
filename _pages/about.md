Welcome to my abode. My name is Vignesh Nanda Kumar. I am currently working as a AI Researcher at AI Labs, American Express. I am a Computer Science graduate from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus (2019 passout).

Having explored the field of Computer Science through my courses, projects, and work experiences, I have identified my areas of interest in Systems and Large-Scale Machine Learning (ML). 

I am currently exploring more about scaling ML algorithms and processing data efficiently without compromising on the performance of ML systems. With the increase in usage of ML systems, there is a need to ensure that the system is adaptable and reusable across use cases. Motivated by my experiences, I want to lead the development of ML systems impacting society on a large scale. Through this, I hope to bridge the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged to create equal opportunities for everyone.

Also, I am trying to cultivate a regular reading habit. My goal is to read at least 12 books this year. I am also a very ardent cricket fan.
