Welcome to my abode. My name is Vignesh Nanda Kumar. I am pursuing **Masters in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)**. I am currently working with **[Professor Arun Kumar](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~arunkk/), in [ADA Lab@UCSD](https://adalabucsd.github.io/)**, developing scalable ML systems. My work is pertaining to the [Cerebro](https://adalabucsd.github.io/cerebro.html) project (scalable deep learning model selection framework) and in my first quarter @ UCSD, I worked on integrating **[Cerebro with Dask](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-chrx22wGqx5fTEnND5NJvyzkfP4ERL/view?usp=sharing)**.

I am specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Systems** during my Masters at UCSD along with working on ML Systems. Towards specializing in Systems, I took up the course **[Data Systems for Machine Learning](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//classes/fa21/cse234-a/)**, and [Computer Architecture](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse240a-f21/lecture-materials) in my first quarter @UCSD. For my second quarter, I took up the **Graduate Network Systems** course, research project advised by **Professor Arun Kumar in ADA Lab**. I am planning to learn **Natural Langauge Processing** in my Spring quarter aiding me in my work with multi-model data ETL in ADALab.

I did my Bachelors in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus (2019 graduate). During my time at BITS, I took up courses and projects from different areas and developed an interest in the area of **Large Scale Software Systems and Machine Learning**. I have interned at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education which was my first experience of working on a large-scale project in a team. I have also worked at Goldman Sachs as a Summer Analyst where I got to apply concepts of Parallel Computing (Foster's Design Methodology) while developing a pluggable email scanner. After my undergraduate, I worked at American Express AI Labs as an **AI Researcher**.

I am exploring more about scaling ML algorithms and processing data efficiently without compromising on the performance of ML systems. With the increase in usage of ML systems, there is a need to ensure that the system is adaptable and reusable across use cases. Motivated by my experiences, I want to lead the development of ML systems impacting society on a large scale. Through this, I hope to bridge the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged to create equal opportunities for everyone.

I am also a very ardent cricket fan and love reading, listening and knowing more about the game from fellow cricket enthusiasts and journalists on Twitter ([@beastieboy07](https://twitter.com/beastieboy07), [@melindafarrell](https://twitter.com/melindafarrell), [@gurkiratsgill](https://twitter.com/gurkiratsgill), [@1tip1hand](https://twitter.com/1tip1hand), [@gradecricketer](https://twitter.com/gradecricketer), [@RandomCricketP1](https://twitter.com/RandomCricketP1), [@Cric_Beyond_Ent](https://twitter.com/Cric_Beyond_Ent)).

I am also trying to develop a regular reading habit. My [reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93612944-vignesh-nanda-kumar)
