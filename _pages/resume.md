Education
======
* Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Computer Science, Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Pilani Campus <div align="right"> **Aug '15 - Jun '19** </div>


Professional Experience
======
* Research Engineer  AI Labs, American Express (Amex), Bengaluru, India     Jul '19 - Present
  * Responsibilities: Developing new features and maintaining existing features for the AXGBoost algorithm (have contributed to 4 releases till date); exploring new research problems relevant to the business for future products.
  * Projects:
    * Improvement of XGBoost Distributed Algorithm
        * Researching on weights used in Weighted Quantile Sketch algorithm by comparing trees built using Single Machine and Distributed XGBoost algorithm.
        * Proved empirically and theoretically the scope for optimising weights used by the Distributed XGBoost algorithm. Working on deriving weights more faithful to the XGBoost objective function.
    * Development of a Universal Search Pipeline
        * Developed an end-to-end system that enables context-aware search for enterprise wide unstructured information retrieval using Neo4j, Machine Reading Comprehension algorithm, and Django. (Amongst the 5 projects selected out of 13 as part of an internal ideation workshop).
        * Set up internal end-user tests and found that 73\% of the queries are answered in the top 10 results.
    * Development of features for AXGBoost
        * Optimized the distributed algorithm code base from a 2400+ lines code to \textless 500 lines for the new version of AXGBoost (Amex XGBoost) in C++ for better maintainability (has been used in building 10,000+ models internally).
        * Working on providing GPU support using CUDA for the new version of AXGBoost algorithm.
